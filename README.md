# Game Engine OpenGL TODO CHANGE NAME!!

## DESCRIPTION
TODO: create and change the name of project<br>
<name_of_project> is a simple game engine that renders some basic 3D objects. 
Using a GUI you can generate various 3D objects, execute transformation (such as rotating, translating, scaling), apply shaders and place custom textures. 
User can move around the scene using a camera and change the view with the mouse. 
There is also straightforward light physics (one source of light that affects the objects). 
The project is written in C++ and uses OpenGL, and other external libraries that are described [here](#external-libraries).<br>
This is also my bachelor's thesis project.
